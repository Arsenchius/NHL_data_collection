# Prediction Model for NHL

### Description

Using machine learning algorithms i build predictive model

### Data

Collected data took from [flashscore](https://www.flashscorekz.com/hockey/). This website provides a lot of sport results, including football, tennis and other sport games. Probably site collects results just for last 7 days and updates every day. To collect a huge dataset for better accuracy of my model, i should collect data for several days.
`parser.py` is a script which collects results of games played for last week and table standings of teams for current day.
All collected data based in `data` folder.
